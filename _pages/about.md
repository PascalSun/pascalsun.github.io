I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Western Australia.
My research interests include knowledge graph construction, natural language processing, knowledge graph embedding,
knowledge graph enhanced retrieval augmented generation, knowledge graph reasoning, multimodal large language models,
and knowledge discovery from unstructured data.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a full-stack developer at Artrya and MetroCount. Successfully commercialized the
AI-based coronary artery disease evaluation platform, Salix, and the revolutionary traffic data management platform,
ATLYST, and the Real-Time traffic data collection solution, RoadPod VM.

I am passionate about bringing research into reality and making a difference in the world.
I believe I am capable and currently working on making this happen in Western Australia.
If you are interested in collaborating with me or have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
